    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to explore how we can use the package Beautiful Soup to extract content from XML files. \n",
    "We use the same example file that was used in lesson **2** ([download here](https://github.com/MirjamC/xml-workshop/tree/master/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is divided into the following steps:\n",
    "- Load the XML file;\n",
    "- Examine the structure of the XML file;\n",
    "- Extract the booktitles and descriptions;\n",
    "- Extract name and surname of the author;\n",
    "- Extract the book identifier;\n",
    "- Structure all information;\n",
    "- Explore namespaces;\n",
    "- Extra: Filter information\n",

    "## Install Beautiful Soup\n",

    "Beautifull Soup is not a standard Python package, so it needs to be installed first.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "!pip install beautifulsoup4\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
